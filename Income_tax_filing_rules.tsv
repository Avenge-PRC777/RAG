There will be lot of tabs but to file a return, you should refer to "eFile" tab in menu which will have 2 options majorly: Income Tax Returns, Income Tax Forms

The difference between Income Tax Returns and Income Tax Forms is there are various kinds of forms. ITR1 is a kind of form that is used for reporting tax related details to government. That is for Income Tax Returns purposes. Whereas any other form is present in Income Tax Forms.

ITR or Income Tax Return is a form in which taxpayers file information about their income earned and tax application. They report this to the income tax department.

Assessment year is the current financial year. If you are filing for financial year 2022-23 then your assessment year is current financial year 2023-24.

It is recommended to go for online way of filing tax.

There are 3 status applicable: Individual, HUF, Others. Others can have subcategories like Company (as per 2 (17) of the I.T Act) or Association of Persons or Limited Liability Parntership.

To understand the 3 status categories, legal entity needs to be understood. A legal entity is an entity that has legal rights and responsibilities, including the ability to enter into contracts, own properties and sue or be sued. A legal entity can be human or non human like a company.

	In this context, Individual is a legal entity such as a human whose income from any source exceeds the basic exemption limit set by government. Such entities must have to file an individual return for themselves and declare all of their sources of income if it is more than the limit. In other words, if more than basic limit, at the end of financial year, you have to file an Individual based ITR.
	In this context, HUF or Hindu Undivided Family is a legal entity which files taxes as a separate entity whereas its members file taxes individually as usual. For example if 3 family members have a clothe shop, then they have to file taxes for the business under HUF status, declaring the profits and expenses. The income tax rate will apply as per business structure - sole proprietorship or partnership or private limited company. The exemptions will apply differently. Now the profit from the business can be shared amongst family members. For each family member, then this profit becomes a source of income that they have to declare in their individual tax returns. So, when you select HUF in income tax portal it means you are filing tax FOR THE BUSINESS THAT IS OPERATED BY HUF and not for yourself. In other words, if more than basic limit, at the end of financial year, you must file 2 ITRs, one as Individual with you being the legal entity and the other for HUF, where HUF is the legal entity.
		Yes, HUF is only for Hindu class of religions - Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhists. Only they can form HUF.
	In this context, Company(as per 2(17) of the I.T Act),Association of Persons (AOP) / (BOI),Limited Liability Partnership (LLP),Local Authority,Partnership Firm,Artificial Juridical Person (AJP) which appear under "Others" are also other instances of legal entities, each having its own definition and tax regimes. If you have an association with any of the options, you may have to file one return for that in addition to your Individual return.

There are 7 ITR forms to choose from. Usually under Individual status, ITR 5,6,7 are for companies and hence not selectable. Different ITR forms have different conditions.

To understand ITRs, it is essential to understand some terms.

	Salary income, business income and profession income are 3 different incomes and not the same. Salary income is the income an individual receives for services rendered to an employer in form of bonuses/wages/commissions or other such benefits. Business income is the income an individual receives from operating a business, for example from sale of products or services. Profression income is the income an individual receives by practicing profession for example a lawyer or doctor charges fee for practicing their profession in a clinic. Another example can be that of a freelance writer.

	ITR4 is similar to ITR1 but the difference is if you have opted for presumption taxation scheme, then you have to apply for ITR4. Presumptive taxation scheme is for small business owners who find it difficult to maintain expense records and books (expense records contain cost prices that must be deducted from business income to get profit which is taxable). For example, Rohit earned 8 lakh from business in a year and if he finds expense managing difficult, under this scheme he can choose to pay 8% of income that is 64000 INR as tax. Through normal route, he would have to calculate expenses say 3 lakh and now the profit 5 lakh would be taxable under the appropriate slab.

The section "Are you filing the income tax return for any of the following reasons?"
As per this  clause (iv) of Seventh Proviso Section 139 (1), it is mandatory to file an ITR for certain individuals who carry out specific high-value transactions, even if their total income is below the basic exemption limit. This means that even if these individuals are not otherwise required to file an income tax return, they must do so if they meet the conditions specified in this clause. For example, if you spent 3 lakh on London trip, as per the seventh proviso to section 139(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is mandatory to file an income tax return if you have incurred expenditure of an amount or aggregate of the amounts exceeding two lakh rupees for yourself or any other person for travel to a foreign country1. You would fall under this category. Therefore, you would be required to file an income tax return under this provision, even if your total income is below the basic exemption limit. Similarly, if you deposit more than 1 crore anywhere or spend more than 1 lakh for electricity in a financial year, you need to select this if your income is not taxable.

The section Are you opting for new tax regime u/s 115BAC ?
Here are the tax slabs and rates for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) under the new regime:
